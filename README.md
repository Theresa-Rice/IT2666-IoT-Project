## Description  
The Smart Bin System is an Internet of Things (IoT) project developed for the IT2666 module. It uses sensors and a microcontroller to detect the fill level of a waste bin and display the status through a connected application. The project demonstrates practical IoT concepts such as sensor integration, data monitoring, and basic automation to reduce unnecessary waste collection and improve efficiency.
